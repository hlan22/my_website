This is my first website, so here I will talk about important info I learn here!

-   For basic information on Quarto websites I started with: <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

Any special customization that I do, I hope to outline here as a guide to making your own!

### Markdown tips

-   To receive the outline shown on the right-hand side of this page, specify in the YAML header the following: `toc: true`.

### Styling and Rendering

-   Create a `styles.css` file (in the same directory as your `index.qmd` file) to create custom HTML styling.
    -   For example, the way I created the purple box shown at the bottom of this page is done by putting the following in the `styles.css` file:

``` html
.purplebox {
    background-color: #e3dfff; /* Light Purple */
    border: 3px solid #7a5fa3; /* Dark Purple */
    color: #3d236f; /* Text Color */
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
```

         
- Which you can then execute by putting this in your document:


```HTML
\:\:\:\: purplebox
\:\:\: center

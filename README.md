# <div align="center"> Heidi Lantz's Personal Portfolio </div>

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! :tada:

This is my first website that I learned to make through Quarto documents, and be hosted on GitHub. 
I plan to develop this website into a personal portfolio, 
as well as create other websites that contain my knowledge/explanations for subjects that I am passionate about!

Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)

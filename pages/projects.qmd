# 3. DSCI 310: Reproducible and Trustworthy Workflows {#reproducible}

An analysis and package that is a fully reproducible and robust data analysis project, comprised of:

* A well documented and modularized **software package** and **scripts written in R**,
* A **data analysis pipeline** automated with **GNU Make** and Makefile's,
* A reproducible report powered by R Markdown and **Quarto**,
* A **containerized computational environment** created and made shareable by Docker, and
* A remote version control repository on GitHub for project collaboration and sharing, 
* As well as automation of **test suite execution and documentation** and software deployment.

For my group's work, see the R package repository [here](https://hlan22.github.io/asa_datafest_2025/#/title-slide) and the analysis repository [here](https://github.com/DSCI-310-2025/dsci-310-group-7-data-dudes).

# 6. `wordplayr` - An R Package {#word}

* The aim of `wordplay` is to learn more about your favorite list of words! Learn about metrics such as length, most frequent starting letter, and much more with ease!
* A fully functioning R package with clear `README.Rmd` instructions on how to install and use, along with a vignette, website, and Roxygen comments to help guide the user.
* I have built up a 'list of favorite words' over the years and wanting to learn more about them is what inspired me to make this package!
* See the [R package repository](https://github.com/hlan22/wordplay) and the [package website](https://hlan22.github.io/wordplay/).

# 7. Python Dashboard & Data Visualization


#### DSCI 320 Dashboard

With two group members, we created the following dashboard where we had to create inventive visualizations to explain 4 questions. We looked into trends for attendance at libraries in the San Francisco area. The dashboard is interactive and has toggle options that don't show up in the saved image.

# 8. `easyEDA` - A Python Package (In development) {#easy}

* A Python Package (still in progress) such that you can “automate” EDA for any given dataset. 
* Functions will quickly and easily create proper plots based on data types, for any and all columns. 
* Code will be done with Python so that you can include interactive visuals, but will expand to R too.
* Link to the repository [here](https://github.com/hlan22/easy_eda)

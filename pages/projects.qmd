# Student Statistical Consultant (Capstone Project) {#capstone}

* With guidance from Dr. Rodolfo Lourenzutti, I worked for a client analyzing changes in glaucoma eye surgery in an apprentice type of job.
* Real client work, regular meetings with the professor presenting work, poster board and oral presentations
* Produced reports, code, and worked directly for the client using the R programming language and GitHub
* Learned about complications with study design, model selection, and effective statistical communication
* See our poster we presented in a [poster board session](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/poster-session-stat-450-2):

* **Winner of “Social Track”** in a 24 hour Hackathon
* Won **3rd place overall**, with 50+ projects and 200+ participants
* Presented work to 7 judges individually, and in the final round presented in front of the entire Hackathon community (over 250+ people).

# Easy EDA (Personal Project) {#easy}

* Personal project such that you can “automate” EDA for any given dataset. 
* I hope to make an R package such that functions will quickly and easily create proper plots based on data types, for any and all columns. All code will be done with R initially, but will expand to Python too, for interactive visuals.

# DSCI 310 Group Project {#reproducible}

* Create a statistical analysis that incorporates these main ideas:
  * Data Pipelines
  * Make and Makefiles
  * Dockerfiles
  * Creating an R Package
* See the repository here: <https://github.com/DSCI-310-2025/dsci-310-group-7-data-dudes>

# Weather Extremes Research {#research}

* Working at UBC from May to August 2024 under an URSA NSERC scholarship
* Working under professors Harry Joe and Natalia Nolde, I found patterns and explanations for climate extremes. 
* Dealt with Canadian weather data, relating to floods, droughts, and wildfires using Python and R languages. 
* Completed EDA and used various statistical analyses to gain insight into weather patterns and time series analysis. 
* Analyzed many research papers, presented work weekly, and assisted both professors with various tasks.
* Will be publishing work on a public repository soon!

# ASA DataFest {#datafest}

* A 48 hour hackathon in a team of 3
* Created a fully reproducible project, with a clear statistical analysis
* Created a dashboard, demonstration video, presentation using quarto, and analysis using a bayesian model
* Project topic and workcan only be revealed after May 7, 2025
* Info about ASA DataFest: <https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/>


# Wordplayr - An R Package

(more info coming soon!)

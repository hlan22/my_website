# Student Statistical Consultant (Capstone Project) {#capstone}

* With guidance from Dr. Rodolfo Lourenzutti, I worked for a client analyzing changes in glaucoma eye surgery in an apprentice type of job.
* Real client work, regular meetings with the professor presenting work, poster board and oral presentations
* Produced reports, code, and worked directly for the client using the R programming language and GitHub
* Learned about complications with study design, model selection, and effective statistical communication
* See our poster we presented in a [poster board session](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/poster-session-stat-450-2):

# Reproducible and Trustworthy Workflows: DSCI 310 Group Project {#reproducible}

* Create a statistical analysis that incorporates these main ideas:
  * Data Pipelines
  * Make and Makefiles
  * Dockerfiles
  * Creating an R Package
* See our analysis repository: <https://github.com/DSCI-310-2025/dsci-310-group-7-data-dudes>

# Weather Extremes Research {#research}

* Working at UBC from May to August 2024 under an URSA NSERC scholarship
* Working under professors Harry Joe and Natalia Nolde, I found patterns and explanations for climate extremes. 
* Dealt with Canadian weather data, relating to floods, droughts, and wildfires using Python and R languages. 
* Completed EDA and used various statistical analyses to gain insight into weather patterns and time series analysis. 
* Analyzed many research papers, presented work weekly, and assisted both professors with various tasks.
* Will be publishing work on a public repository soon!

# ASA DataFest {#datafest}

* A 48 hour Hackathon in a team of 3
* Created a fully reproducible project, with a clear statistical analysis
* Created a dashboard, demonstration video, presentation using quarto, and analysis using a Bayesian model
* Info about ASA DataFest: <https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/>
* See our repository work here: <https://github.com/hlan22/asa_datafest_2025>
* See our presentation here: <https://hlan22.github.io/asa_datafest_2025/#/title-slide>

# Wordplayr - An R Package {#word}

* A fully functioning R package with clear instructions on how to install and use
* The aim of `wordplay` is to learn more about your favorite list of words! Learn about metrics such as length, frequent starting letters, and much more with ease!
* See the package I made here: <https://github.com/hlan22/wordplay>

# Easy EDA (Personal Project) {#easy}

* R Package in development such that you can “automate” EDA for any given dataset. 
* Functions will quickly and easily create proper plots based on data types, for any and all columns. 
* All code will be done with R initially, but will expand to Python too, for interactive visuals.

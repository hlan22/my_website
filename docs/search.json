I hope to finish it soon :)\n:::\n::::\n\nYou can create a dropdown menu by doing the following HTML code:\n\n&lt;details&gt;\n&lt;summary&gt;Dropdown title&lt;/summary&gt;\nContents you want inside the dropdown menu\n&lt;/details&gt; \nWhich looks like:\n\n\nDropdown title\n\nContents you want inside the dropdown menu\n\n\n\nNOTICE!\nPlease know that I am still updating this website… I hope to finish it soon :)"

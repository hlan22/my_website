Student Statistical Consultant (Capstone Project)\n\nWith guidance from Dr. Rodolfo Lourenzutti, I worked for a client analyzing changes in glaucoma eye surgery in an apprentice type of job.\nReal client work, regular meetings with the professor presenting work, poster board and oral presentations\nProduced reports, code, and worked directly for the client using the R programming language and GitHub\nLearned about complications with study design, model selection, and effective statistical communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: STAT 450 Poster Board. See more about the Poster Session here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Daily Grind (CMD-F Hackathon)\n\nA 24 hour Computer Science Hackathon on the weekend of March 8-9th, 2025\nWinners of the “Social Track” for our coffee-chat conversation starter using AI\nWon 3rd place overall, with 50+ projects and 200+ participants\nPresented work to 7 judges individually, and in the final round presented in front of the entire Hackathon community (over 250+ people).\nFor more info, see our Devpost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Preview of the conversation starter app we built! For more info, see our devpost. This is a popup window where you can add additional information to help create useful conversation topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. DSCI 310: Reproducible and Trustworthy Workflows\nAn analysis and package that is a fully reproducible and robust data analysis project, comprised of:\n\nA well documented and modularized software package and scripts written in R,\nA data analysis pipeline automated with GNU Make and Makefile’s,\nA reproducible report powered by R Markdown and Quarto,\nA containerized computational environment created and made shareable by Docker, and\nA remote version control repository on GitHub for project collaboration and sharing,\nAs well as automation of test suite execution and documentation and software deployment.\n\nFor my group’s work, see the R package repository here and the analysis repository here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Screenshot of Package Repository. See the package here and the analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Weather Extremes Research\n\nWorking at UBC from May to August 2024 under an URSA NSERC scholarship\nFinding patterns and explanations for climate extremes. Dealt with Canadian weather data, relating to floods, droughts, and wildfires using Python and R languages. Completed EDA and used various statistical analyses to gain insight into weather patterns and time series analysis.\nAnalyzed many research papers, presented work weekly, and assisted both professor Harry Joe and professor Natalia Nolde with various tasks.\nWork will be published on a public repository soon!\n\n\n\n\n5. ASA DataFest\n\nA 48 hour Hackathon in a team of 3 for the American Statistical Association.\nCreated a fully reproducible project, with EDA and a complex statistical analysis\nCreated a dashboard, demonstration video, presentation using quarto, and analysis using a Bayesian model\nSee the repository: https://github.com/hlan22/asa_datafest_2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASA Datafest Presentation\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: See the presentation at this link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. wordplayr - An R Package\n\nThe aim of wordplay is to learn more about your favorite list of words! Learn about metrics such as length, most frequent starting letter, and much more with ease!\nA fully functioning R package with clear README.Rmd instructions on how to install and use, along with a vignette, website, and Roxygen comments to help guide the user.\nI have built up a ‘list of favorite words’ over the years and wanting to learn more about them is what inspired me to make this package!\nSee the R package repository and the package website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A preview of the package website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Python Dashboard & Data Visualization\n\nDSCI 320 Dashboard\nWith two group members, we created the following dashboard where we had to create inventive visualizations to explain 4 questions. We looked into trends for attendance at libraries in the San Francisco area. The dashboard is interactive and has toggle options that don’t show up in the saved image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Dashboard for a data visualization course (DSCI 320)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. easyEDA - A Python Package (In development)\n\nA Python Package (still in progress) such that you can “automate” EDA for any given dataset.\nFunctions will quickly and easily create proper plots based on data types, for any and all columns.\nCode will be done with Python so that you can include interactive visuals, but will expand to R too.\nLink to the repository here"
